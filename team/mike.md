I'm joining the Ride to Conquer Cancer for the first year, inspired by my friend and colleague [Graham Ballantyne](/team/graham.html). Graham will be riding in this event for the 4th year in a row.
 
I'm healthy. Gratefully so. But I, like most everybody, have had family, friends as well as an alarming -- and growing -- number of colleagues affected by cancer. Some have passed away, some are still battling the disease day by day. Still others are living proof of the the good work that agencies such as the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com) are doing in the fight against cancer. I'd like to do my part to help improve the odds for people battling this disease in its many forms.
 
I'm not the type of person who takes on fundraising events for fun, nor somebody who takes such events lightly. Truly, I'm also terribly uncomfortable asking people to support me, and when confronted with problems I tend to prefer to work though things "on my own". But the truth is that when it comes to cancer none of us can handle it "on our own." 
 
In this event, while I'm hoping to do my small part to help in the fight against cancer, I cannot do it all on my own. For my part, I'll be contributing considerable time in training, my own money for bike maintenance, registration fee and a personal donation, as well as time and energy in promoting the event.  In return, I'd ask that you please consider supporting me, one of my teammates, or another rider in this important awareness and fundraising event.
 
[The Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=va12_homepage) is an epic two-day, 300km bike journey from Vancouver to Seattle on June 16/17, 2012 benefiting the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com). Riders commit to raising a minimum of $2500.
You can help me reach my goal in many ways:

* **[Donate](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=2882930&pg=personal&fr_id=1413)**. Whether you can give $10 or $1000, every dollar counts. You can donate in one shot, or spread your contribution over 2-10 monthly payments. Donations over $10 are tax-deductible.
* Spread the word. Tell your friends and family. Link to this page. Send emails. Tweet about it. Post about it on Facebook, MySpace or whatever the social network du jour is. The URL to my page is: http://www.conquercancer.ca/goto/mstanger

Funds raised in The Ride to Conquer Cancer will support breakthrough research, exemplary teaching, and compassionate care made possible through BC Cancer Foundation, a leader in cancer research and care.
 
Some of the people I'll be thinking about while doing the ride: Grandmothers (on both sides of our extended family, and my great grandmother Julia); Anthony, John C, Joe; my Mom's best friend Shirley; Uncle Bill and his wife Nancy; Aunt Nancy on my Mother's side; Cousin Gerri; Chris, Ross S, John R, Kitty, Jeff, Rhona, L.T.; high-school friend Leah; the mother of my best friend in highschool W.T.; and our sweet neighbour "Betty" who lived next door at my childhood home. It's a long list: and it's not everybody. There are some people that I know who will read this and have also been affected: know that I'm thinking of you as well and haven't forgotten about you, but I'm trying to draw a line between personal privacy and showing how personal my participation in this event is. If you'd be comfortable having your name, initials or our relationship listed here, please let me know: I'm riding for you too.
 
January 28: I just wrote my personal page a couple of weeks ago, and already there is another person represented here. This is more than a bit of a surprise since he had not told the majority of us at work that he was fighting the disease. WoJo: I'm riding for you too.
