This year I've decided to join The Enbridge Ride to Conquer Cancer benefiting BC Cancer Foundation, a two-day cycling journey, through Canada's Pacific region taking place in the summer.  I'll be cycling through the scenic Pacific Northwest with thousands of other Riders. All the proceeds will go to BC Cancer Foundation to support cancer research, treatment, and services. BC Cancer Foundation is a leading comprehensive institution devoted to cancer research and care, and the work they're doing is cutting-edge.

I want to challenge myself to ride 260 kilometers from Vancouver to Seattle, but most importantly challenge myself to raise $2,500 for cancer research in BC.  I have little road biking experience, but thought strapping on some colourful spandex and enduring two days of bike pain is the least I can do for the hardship cancer victims have endured.  We've all been affected by cancer one way or another.

Please help me achieve my goals and donate to BC Cancer today!

Thank you all for your encouragement and support.
