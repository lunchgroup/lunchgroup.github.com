Welcome to my Personal Page! The [Enbridge Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=va12_homepage) benefiting the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com), is a two-day cycling journey, through Canada's Pacific region taking place in the summer. It will be a challenge in a number of ways, but with my bike, my helmet, and your generosity, a real impact will be made! 

Contribute to this history-making event with a [donation](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=2881331&pg=personal&fr_id=1413). Funds raised in [The Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=va12_homepage) will support breakthrough research, exemplary teaching, and compassionate care made possible through [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com), a leader in cancer research and care.

Thank you in advance for your help.
