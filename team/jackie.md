This ride is something I have thought about for a long time, but always put off for another time, well now the time is here.

Everyone knows someone affected by cancer, myself included.  Right now I'm healthy and active; I love mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking and skiing and want to use my love for all activities outdoors to go to a good cause.  I want to use my abilities now to make a difference for those who are dealing with cancer now, those who have won their battle and especially those who fought bravely and are no longer with us.

So my mountain bike is going to trade in its muddy exterior for some shiny road tires and I'm going to ride in a 200km experience with the other members of my team to raise money for the fight against cancer.

Please help me in the fight with donations, all donations over $10 are tax deductable and go to a great cause.

Once again thanks to everyone including the members of my team, Graham, Patrick, Mike, Erin, and Eyrn
