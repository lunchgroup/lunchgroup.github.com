This year I've decided to join The Ride to Conquer Cancer benefiting BC Cancer Foundation, a two-day cycling journey, through Canada's Pacific region taking place in the summer. It will be a challenge in a number of ways, but it's nowhere near the challenge faced by those who have been diagnosed with this terrible disease.
I have designated the funds from my ride to childhood cancers.  As a mother, I can only imagine the pain that a parent has to endure seeing their child live and suffer with cancer.  I hope that my little contribution will help in finding a cure or easing their challenges.

Contribute to this history-making event with a donation. Funds raised in The Ride to Conquer Cancer will support breakthrough research, exemplary teaching, and compassionate care made possible through BC Cancer Foundation, a leader in cancer research and care.

Thank you in advance for your help.
