This summer, I lost my Step-Grandfather to brain cancer. I don't know why I have to call him my step grandfather. For all intents and purposes he was my grandfather. And now he's gone. I'm never going to see him walk through my front door again. I'm never going to see him marvel at the beauty of this world again. I'm never going to hear him say "I love you too, Tamara" again. I miss him. Everyday.

I'm doing this for him. I'm doing this so eventually, no one ever has to go through losing someone they love because of cancer again. If you want to help me reach my goal, and ultimately everyone's goal, of curing cancer, there's an option to donate on this page. I'd appreciate it, but don't do it for me. Do it for who you've lost to cancer.
