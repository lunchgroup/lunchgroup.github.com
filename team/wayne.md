I am riding along with my daughter Erin Westwood and a great team of dedicated men and women, all of us playing a small part in the fight to end cancer. Both my brother Richard and my father Clifford had their lives cut short after suffering with this dreaded disease, all I could do at the time was to try to comfort them and watch as they were taken from us. They were great people, I think of them each and every day and wish they were here with us.

Now it is my turn to make a difference, with your help we can together make this dream happen, please support me in The Ride to Conquer Cancer 2013. I will be riding from Vancouver to Seattle in June 2013 and need your financial commitment to raise $3200.00.

Your generosity will be appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.
