Hi there. Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Eryn Holbrook. This is my inaugural Ride to Conquer Cancer and I couldn't be more excited (or scared). Did I really sign up for a 320km bike ride from Vancouver to Seattle? Looks like I've got a lot of training ahead of me but, with your support, I'll be well on my way to reaching my goals.

By the way, as you may have heard, I'm riding with a team of friends and colleagues, many of whom work with me at [SFU](http://www.sfu.ca). Although we'll be riding together, we have to raise funds individually, so when you make a donation here you'll be supporting me directly.

Here's how you can help:

* [Donation](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=2883391&pg=personal&fr_id=1413) of any amount will help the BC Cancer Foundation to find a cure for Cancer.  Donation can be made via this webpage or by printing out the donation page and mailing it in (All donations are 100% tax deductible, and are non-refundable and non-transferable. Any donations of $10 or more will receive a tax receipt via an email or regular snail mail).
* Spread the words about this cause of finding a cure for Cancer and/or help us fundraise.
* [Volunteer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=12_crew) your time to help out with the event
 
So, before you leave this page, please consider showing your support by making a [donation](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=2883391&pg=personal&fr_id=1413) or [volunteering](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=12_crew). I truly believe that, with your generosity, we will conquer this devastating disease.
