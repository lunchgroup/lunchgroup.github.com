In June of 2012, I embarked on an epic journey from Vancouver to Seattle with one goal: to put an end to cancer. It was one of the most challenging experiences I've ever taken on, and I'm excited to push my personal limits again in 2013. With the support of my 11-person team, Lunchgroup Heavy Industries, and thousands of others, I'm looking forward to giving it my all. This year, I'm dedicated to training hard and riding harder.

But I can't do it without you.

A donation of any amount will help the BC Cancer Foundation to find a cure for cancer through research and help those struggling with cancer with the latest therapy and treatment. Donations can be made via this webpage or by printing out the donation page and mailing it in.

All donations are 100% tax deductible and any donations of $10 or more will receive a tax receipt. If you can't make a donation, please consider donating your time and energy to this important cause. On-site volunteers are always welcome!

I truly believe that, with your generosity, we will conquer this devastating disease. Thank you for your support!
