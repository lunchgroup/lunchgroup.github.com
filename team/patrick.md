I used to be an avid skier, hiker and rollerblader turned to an avid outdoor (hardcore want to be) rockclimber. I also used to play tennis and do a bit of running when I was younger too.  However with that all said, I am scared of doing this 300km ride.  This will be my 1st year riding for the [Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=va12_homepage) and hopefully it won't be my last.  I would like to thank all my relatives and friends who have fought cancer and [Graham](/team/graham.html) for inspiring me to do this ride.
 
Cancer has been affecting us more and more and I think it is time we need to find a cure from it.  While I am still young-ish, I would like to be able to contribute to this cause.  This bicycle Ride To Conquer Cancer benefitting the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com) will take us through a 300km breathtaking journey (spreading over 2 days Jun. 16 & 17, 2012) from Vancouver, BC, Canada to Seattle, WA, USA.  Before I am entitled to do this ride, I need to raise at least $2500 for the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com).
