The Enbridge Ride to Conquer Cancer benefiting BC Cancer Foundation, is a two-day cycling journey, from Vancouver to Seattle. As a rider I am required to raise $2500 to participate....Funds raised in The Ride to Conquer Cancer will support breakthrough research, exemplary teaching, and compassionate care made possible through BC Cancer Foundation, a leader in cancer research and care.

As most of you that know I am active in softball and a bit of golf, but most of you wouldn't even know I even owned a bike.....so me doing this ride might be a bit of a shock. I have lost too many loved ones over the years to this disease; my grandmother Hazel Lillian Reid, grandfather Clifford Marcus English, my dad Richard James English and just recently my father in-law Clifford Voeltz.

Lots of people lose people so why do this ride.....Honestly "I miss my Dad" he's been gone for 14 years now but over the last couple years it seems I miss him more and more to the point where it bring tears to my eyes. This was my wake up call to try to do something. This past summer my cousin did the 2012 ride in memory of our grandfather and my dad and it really inspired me to do this event.

I can't bring my dad back but....I can ride so that maybe one Daddy's Little Girl doesn't lose her Dad....I can ride so maybe one Granddaughter doesn't grow up without her Grandparents....I will ride in memory of my loved ones lost to this disease.....I do ride in honour of the brave women (you know who you are) I play ball with that have survived this disease and did not give up.

How You Can Help:  Donations of any amount will help the BC Cancer Foundation to find a cure for cancer. Donations can be made by clicking the Donate button to the upper left or by printing out the donation page and mailing it in (all donations are 100% tax deductible, and are non-refundable and non-transferable. Any donations of $10 or more will receive a tax receipt via an email or regular snail mail).

All Riders commit to raising a minimum of $2500.....To put the fundraising requirement in perspective if 125 people I know contribute $20.00 each I would raise the minimum but I think big.....my goal is $5000 to $7500.

I ask you contribute a minimum $20 to this worthy cause and help Conquer Cancer one dollar and one kilometer at a time!!!!!
