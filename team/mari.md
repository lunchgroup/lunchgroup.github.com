The Enbridge Ride to Conquer Cancer benefiting BC Cancer Foundation, is a two-day cycling journey, through Canada's Pacific region taking place in the summer. It will be a challenge in a number of ways, but with my bike, my helmet, and your generosity, a real impact will be made!

Contribute to this history-making event with a donation. Funds raised in The Ride to Conquer Cancer will support breakthrough research, exemplary teaching, and compassionate care made possible through BC Cancer Foundation, a leader in cancer research and care.


Thank you in advance for your help.
