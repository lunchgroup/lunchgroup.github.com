Almost everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer and chances are it can happen in the imidiate family. It's very inspiraing to see Cancer survivors continue on and fight for their lives. I'd like to help and joining The Ride to Conquer Cancer is something I can do. It's a 250km bike journey from Vancouver to Seattle on June 16th and 17th. All proceeds go directly to the BC Cancer Foundation, and are 100% tax deductible.

My goal is to raise $2500. Please help me get there, and support me as I train to ride in June 2013 for this amazing cause.

If you've given a dollar, you are part of The Ride to Conqure Cancer.

Thank you for your support!

I would like to dedicate this ride to my family/friends who fought Cancer:

* Ronnie Gorrie
* Kama Souter
* WB.
