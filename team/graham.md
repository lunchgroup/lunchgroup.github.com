In late 2008 I saw an ad on TV for something called the [Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=va12_homepage). I'd had it in my mind for a while to do a big charity ride and this event seemed appropriate. Almost everyone either knows someone who has been affected by cancer, or had been directly affected themselves. Thanks to advances in research and treatment, many beat the disease. Too many do not, despite the outstanding care here in BC, so I signed up, hoping to make a difference. In short, the ride was an incredible experience - so amazing that I've been doing it ever since; 2012 will be my fourth Ride to Conquer Cancer.

The Ride to Conquer Cancer is an epic two-day, 300km bike journey from Vancouver to Seattle on June 16/17, 2012 benefiting the [BC Cancer Foundation](http://bccancerfoundation.com). Riders commit to raising a minimum of $2500, with all proceeds going directly to the BCCF.

In previous years I've ridden informally with a friend or two, but this year I decided to step up and form a team: [Lunchgroup Heavy Industries](http://lunchgroup.org). Made up of five other riders, we're on a mission: a mission to conquer cancer, one kilometer at a time. **But we need your help to do it.**

You can help us meet our goal by:

* [Donating](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=1817895&pg=personal&fr_id=1413). While we ride as a team, our fundraising is individual and we've each committed to raising at least **$2500**.
* Coming to our fundraiser on March 29th -- more info soon! 
* [Volunteering](http://va12.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=12_crew) your time to help out with the event. The volunteer crew are the backbone of the Ride and we couldn't do it without them!

Thanks for your time, and please, **[give generously!](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2012?px=1817895&pg=personal&fr_id=1413)** And finally, thank you to [Eryn](/team/eryn.html), [Patrick](/team/patrick.html), [Jackie](/team/jackie.html), [Mike](/team/mike.html) and [Erin](/team/erin.html) for riding with me. You all inspire me every day to do better.
