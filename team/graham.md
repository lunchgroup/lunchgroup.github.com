In late 2008 I saw an ad on TV for something called the Ride to Conquer Cancer. I'd had it in my mind for a while to do a big charity ride and this event seemed appropriate. Almost everyone either knows someone who has been affected by cancer, or had been directly affected themselves. Thanks to advances in research and treatment, many beat the disease. Too many do not, despite the outstanding care here in BC, so I signed up, hoping to make a difference. In short, the 2009 ride was an incredible experience - so amazing that I signed up for 2010 at the half-way camp during the ride. In 2010, I signed up for 2011 before the ride even started.
The Ride to Conquer Cancer is an epic two-day, 300km bike journey from Vancouver to Seattle on June 18/19, 2011 benefiting the BC Cancer Foundation. Riders commit to raising a minimum of $2500. Last year I raised $3170. This year, I'm aiming for $5000. You can help me reach my goal in many ways:
