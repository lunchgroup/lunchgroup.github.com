                <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height:25px">On Sunday, June 17 at 3pm, Lunchgroup Heavy Industries rolled across the finish line of the 2012 BC Ride to Conquer Cancer. Collectively raising nearly $17000 and cycling 240km from Surrey to Redmond, we were all simles if not a little bit soggy.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height:25px">We want to extend an enormous <strong>thank you</strong> to everyone who supported us on this epic quest: everyone who made donations, who came to our fundraising events, who sent us words of encouragement during the ride &mdash; you know who you are, and we could not have done this without you.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height:25px">The Lunchgroup will be riding again in 2013; join us, and help us conquer cancer, one kilometer at a time.</p>

            <h1>About the Ride</h1>
            <p>We are on a mission &ndash; a mission to conquer cancer. The Ride to Conquer Cancer is a unique, two-day cycling event to take place on June 16-17, 2012. We will spend two days riding through the beautiful Pacific Northwest, from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, WA. But before we put padded shorts to saddle, we have an important task: raising funds for the <a href="http://bccancerfoundation.com/">BC Cancer Foundation</a>. <strong>Each of the six members of the team has committed to raising at least $2500, but we know we can do much, much more.</strong> Every dollar we raise goes directly to the BC Cancer Foundation to support leading clinicians, scientists, and researchers find new discoveries, having a real impact in our community, across Canada, and around the world.</p>

            <h2>Why Cancer</h2>
            <p>Because cancer doesnâ€™t discriminate, and the cause is one we can all relate to. Though as citizens of BC we are fortunate to have access to some of the best treatment facilities in the world, Cancer still claims thousands of lives here and across Canada every year (2009 Cancer Statistics: 45% of men and 40% of women will develop cancer in their lifetime and 1 in all 4 Canadians will die of cancer). Each and every one of us probably knows someone who has been affected by cancer, and thanks to the work done at the BC Cancer Agency, the odds are getting beter and better every year. But we&#8217;re not there yet, not by a long shot. <strong>That&#8217;s why we ride.</strong></p>

	<h1>Meet The Team</h1>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span12">
            <p>Lunchgroup Heavy Industries formed as a team in the winter of 2012. Our team captain, Graham, has participated in the Ride to Conquer Cancer every year since 2009, but always solo or riding informally with a friend or two. This year, he wanted to step it up a notch and recruited five other riders: Mike, Eryn, Patrick, Erin and Jackie. We come from different backgrounds, but we have one common goal: <strong>seeing cancer elimiated within our lifetimes</strong>. Click an image of a rider below to learn more about them.</p>

            <p>Graham, Mike and Eryn all work in the same office in a tight-knit team that almost always eats lunch together. The group dubbed itself The Lunchgroup sometime in the distant past, and Graham tacked on "Heavy Industries" after seeing the term stamped on the engine block of his car. True story.</p>
            <p>In addition to conquering cancer, Lunchgroup Heavy Industries also produces instructional films on such subjects as <a href="https://vimeo.com/8712127">making coffee</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/19410951">knitting</a>, and has been <a href="http://twitter.com/lunchgroup" >Keeping Lunchtime Safe Since 2009</a>.</p>
